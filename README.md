# LibQPEP
A library that deals with generalized quadratic pose estimation problems (QPEPs). The algorithm aims to obtain globally optimal pose together with globally optimal covariance estimates. Typically it can solve the following problems:

1. Perspective-n-Points (PnP)
2. Perspective-n-Lines (PnL)
3. Perspective-n-Points and Lines (PnPL)
4. Hand-eye Calibration
5. Point-to-plane Registration
6. Conics-based Camera Pose Estimation
7. Multi-robot relative pose problem from range measurements
8. Forward kinematics of parallel robots
9. Multi-GNSS attitude determination problem

# Usage
The C++ codes are built using ```CMake``` toolkit under the ```C++11``` programming standard. The codes have been verified on the ```Ubuntu 14.04/16.04/18.04``` (```GCC``` Compilers 5.0 ~ 10.0), Mac ```OS X 10.5.8/10.6.8/10.7.5/10.8.5/10.9.5/10.10/10.12/10.14/10.15``` (```Clang``` Compilers 3 ~ 11). We support multiple architectures, including x86, armhf, arm64, etc.

In the C++ code, the file ```main.cpp``` contains demos of pose and covariance estimation. The function ```QPEP_grobner``` solves the QPEP via Groebner-basis elimination by Larsson et al. https://github.com/vlarsson. Using ```QPEP_lm_single```, the solved pose will be refined by the Levenberg-Marquadt (LM) iteration. Finally, the function ```csdp_cov``` estimates the covariance information.

The LibQPEP can be accelerated by many parallel-computing approaches, including BLAS, LAPACK, CUBLAS (CUDA), Metal Performance Shaders, and OpenCL. 

The LibQPEP now supports multi-architecture hardwares including Nvidia TK1/TX1/TX2/Xavier, RK3399, NXP iMX.6x Series, and softwares including MATLAB R2007~R2022.

## Dependencies
1. Mandatory dependencies are: ```X11```, ```LAPACK```, ```BLAS```, ```Eigen3```. For ```OSX``` and ```macOS``` users, please feel free to install the dependencies via ```Homebrew``` or ```MacPorts```.
2. ```OpenCV``` is optional. However, if you need visualization of covariances, OpenCV must be installed. We support ```OpenCV 2.x to 4.x```.
3. To enable ```OpenCL``` support, please install ```ViennaCL``` (https://github.com/viennacl/viennacl-dev). Also note that, the ```OpenCL``` is efficient only if the graphics devices are based on either Intel/ARM Graphics or Intel Compute Stick. For NVidia/AMD/ATI graphics card, the memory copy processing time is significantly longer.

## C++ Compilation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zarathustr/LibQPEP
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make install
```
Note: Using ```Clang``` compiler on Unbuntu 16.04, 18.04 will be much faster than ```GCC```! For Ubuntu 20.04 and macOS, the execution speed will be consistent. To use the ```Clang``` compiler in ```CMake```, follow these instructions:
```
CC=/usr/bin/clang CXX=/usr/bin/clang cmake ..
make install
```
where ```/usr/bin/clang``` directs to the path of the installed ```Clang``` compiler.

## Demo Program
Just run
```bash
./LibQPEP-test
```
To specify an algorithm to test, please use:
```
./LibQPEP-test [PnP | PtoP | Hand-eye]
```
A successful execution of ```./LibQPEP-test PtoP``` (Point-to-Plane Registration) will output:

![alt tag](test_result.png)

To include a certain data file for test, please run:
```
./LibQPEP-test [PnP | PtoP | Hand-eye] data_file
```
For instance, if you would like to try dataset ```pTop_data-2500pt-1.txt``` in ```data``` folder, use the following command:
```
./LibQPEP-test PtoP /data/pTop_data-2500pt-1.txt
```
which will output:

## Library Installation
This depends on the CMake prefix you set by ```-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path_to_your_install```. The standard path is ```/usr/local```. Use ```make install``` to install the headers and libraries along with ```CMake``` and ```pkgconfig``` files.

## Troubleshooting
1. On the Linux machines, if you encounter the following error:
```
No rule to make target '/usr/local/share/LibQPEP/cmake/../../../lib/libLibQPEP.a'
```
Please use the following command:
```
sudo ln -s /usr/local/share/LibQPEP/cmake/../../../lib/libLibQPEP.so /usr/local/share/LibQPEP/cmake/../../../lib/libLibQPEP.a
```
provided that your CMake install prefix is ```/usr/local```.
   
2. To specify a certain version of ```OpenCV```, please follow:
    ```
    cmake .. -DOPENCV_VER=X.Y.Z -DOPENCV_PATH=your/path/to/opencv
    ```
    where ```OPENCV_VER``` is the exact version of your ```OpenCV``` (e.g. 3.2.0, 4.5.0, 2.4.9), while ```OPENCV_PATH``` directs to the install prefix path, e.g. /usr/local for default.

3. For ```OpenCV``` 3.2.0 installed by ```Debian APT``` package manager, the intrinsic usage of fast math will be a little bit inaccurate, which induces a bit inconsistency of covariance ellipses with statistical and QPEP tests.

## MATLAB Demo Kit
The ```MATLAB``` of version over R2007b is required for proper evaluation. The MATLAB demo kit mainly consists of examples showing how QPEPs are constructed and solved. Three files ```syms_hand_eye.m, syms_pnp.m, syms_pTop.m``` contain symbolic generators for expression functions of hand-eye calibration, PnP and point-to-plane registration problems. Two test files ```test_rel_att.m``` and ```test_stewart.m``` illustrate how range-based relative pose problem and the forward kinematics problem of Stewart platform can be transformed into QPEPs. The final three files ```test_cov_hand_eye.m, test_cov_pnp.m``` and ```test_cov_pTop.m``` consist of globally optimal solutions and covariance estimation. The comparison with method of Nguyen et al. is shown in ```nguyen_covariance.m```. This comparison with Nguyen et al. requires installation of ```Python 2.7```, with packages of ```numpy```, ```trimesh```, ```scipy```, and ```matplotlib (2.2.4, strict!)```. The implementation is ported directly from the original authors' repository https://github.com/dinhhuy2109/python-cope. Users can change the path in the script to choose the proper Python interpreter. In covariance estimation codes of MATLAB, we use the SeDuMi as a general optimizer, since it is free and flexible.

# How to Contribute to LibQPEP?
The C++ version of LibQPEP originates from its MATLAB version codes in the ```code``` folder. To define a quadratic pose estimation problem (QPEP), we recommend that the problem can be written in the form of scalar objective function ```L``` such that the pose ```T``` on SE(3) is optimized via ```argmin J```, subject to the SO(3) constraints in ```T```. Then, please follow the ```syms*``` files in the root of MATLAB demo codes to generate the required numerical matrices for QPEP. After that, you may need to convert the matrices into C++ callable functions. Please refer to ```misc_*_funcs.cpp``` files for such a conversion. Finally, you may solve the problem via the provided solvers. If one needs the covariance estimation, please follow the steps in ```main.cpp```, where an example of the covariance estimation of point-to-plane registration has been presented. We expect that more problems can be solved in the QPEP fashion!
